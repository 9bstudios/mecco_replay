# mecco_replay

Replay is a powerful alternative to MODO's native macro recording tools. It provides a custom command listener for more accurate recording, and a GUI editor, file manager, and playback. It was originally developed by Mechanical Color LLC as a proprietary paid product, and is now released as open-source under the MIT license.
