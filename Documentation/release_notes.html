      <h2>1.2.0</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Save As fixed: </strong>
          Save As no longer prompts the user to save a second time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Built-In Macro Recorder: </strong>Because of a limitation of the current MODO API, we have been forced to
          use the built-in Macro recorder for reliability.</p>
          <p>This means that the steps
          you see in the Replay window during recording may be different from the
          ones that appear after recording is finished. To help make this less jarring,
          the steps are displayed in gray italic during recording, and then change
          to normal black text when recording is complete.</p>
          <p>The upside is that we can now correctly record certain tool interactions
          that we previously could not. The downsides are many, including an inability
          to record proper names for some commands ("Unit Cube Item" is now displayed
          as "Run Script..."), and certain MODO bugs like the inability to record
          very small distance value changes ("1um" is now recorded as "0.0").</p>
          <p>We do hope that in the future we can go back to using our built-in recorder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>layout.createOrClose: </strong>
          Since we are now using the built-in macro recorder, the preference to record
          <code>layout.createOrClose</code> has been removed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1.1.0</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Play button uses built-in interpreter: </strong>
          Clicking the green 'play' button in the Replay window used to fire each command in the Macro one-by-one using "lx.eval". In certain cases this behavior did not match perfectly with the internal script interpreter's behavior. As a workaround, Replay now stores an external temp file with the latest LXM code, and fires it using the built-in '@' syntax, thus using the built-in Macro interpreter every time. Behavior should now match perfectly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed "tool echo" bug, with one caveat...: </strong>
          You can now record modeling operations like Bevel or Push without extra "tool.doApply" commands being added at inappropriate places. The fix does come with a catch: recording cannot support shift+LMB tool refiring. This is a limitation of the current MODO SDK, and we hope to fix it as soon as the SDK is patched.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moved Help: </strong>
          Moved documentation links to the Help > Kit Help menu where they belong.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed Python export bug: </strong>
          Macro style block indent is now removed during Python export
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Save As: </strong>
          Macro... > Save As is effectively like Export, except without the extra format options. (Added for consistency with MODOs File menu.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UI improvements: </strong>
          The Replay button in the modes tail is now a toggle button, and recording prefs can no longer be changed during recording
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bug fixes: </strong>
          Lots of under-the-hood fixes and improvements
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LPK support: </strong>
          Zipped kit folder can now be renamed with the .lpk extension for automated installation. (Not implemented for mechanicalcolor.com distribution.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error handling: </strong>
          Added error handling when Scripts directory is empty, a warning is fired when attempting to run a script that is currently open in the editor, and several other situations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1.0.5</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Added Documentation to Help Menu: </strong>
          Help > Replay Help<br />
          Help > Replay Hotkey Reference<br />
          Htlp > Replay Release Notes
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Added tooltips in modes tail: </strong>
          Tooltips now appear for the Replay icons in the MODO modes tail.
        </li>
